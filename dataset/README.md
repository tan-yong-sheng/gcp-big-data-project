In the recent years, the canker of global warming has been worsened by the continual increase in the emission of Carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from various sources of which automobile vehicles are a part and this threaten the life of humans on earth.

This dataset contains the emission rate of CO2 by vehicles in Canada and is useful in monitoring and predicting carbon dioxide emission rate by automobile vehicles.
'Data Description.csv' contains the description for the various features in the dataset

'co2_emissions_canada.csv' contains the CO2 emission data of vehicles in Canada.

The data comes from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/isaacfemiogunniyi/co2-emission-of-vehicles-in-canada/data

## Data Transformation Plan

We will perform a few data processing via pyspark in Dataproc as follows:
- Remove duplicated rows, if any
- Remove rows with missing values, if any
